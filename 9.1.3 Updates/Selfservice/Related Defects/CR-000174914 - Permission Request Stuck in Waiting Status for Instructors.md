## ⚠️ Issue Summary  
- **Severity:** 🟡 3 - Moderate  
- **Date Resolved:** 🗓️ 2021-03-31  
- **Created Date:** 🗓️ 2020-08-03 22:39:00  
- **Affected Language(s):** 🌐 All  

🔹 **Issue:**  
- When a **student's permission request** is entered via the **Permission Request tab of the course section**, it is **automatically set to "Wait" status**.  
- The **instructor is unable to approve or deny** the request because it appears as **view-only**.  

🛠 **Temporary Workarounds Before Fix:**  
1️⃣ If the **student submits the request via Self-Service**, the instructor **can approve or deny** it normally.  
2️⃣ If the request is **entered manually in the course section tab**, it must be **approved or denied from the same tab**, not via Self-Service.

## 🔍 Client Impact  
- **Instructors could not approve or deny requests** submitted via the back office.  
- **Workflow disruptions** for course enrollment approvals.  
- **Extra administrative effort** was needed to manually approve requests from the back office.  

---

## ✅ Resolution  
🔧 **Fix Implemented:**  
- The **dropdown menu is now enabled** for instructors to **approve or deny permission requests** in Self-Service.  
- **All permission requests, regardless of entry method, are now manageable via Self-Service.**
