## New Features  

### Password policy  
PowerCampus introduces a password policy that allows you to configure a set of rules designated  
to enhance PowerCampus, Self-Service, and PowerCampus User Management security by  
encouraging users or a group of users to use strong passwords and use them properly.  

#### Self-Service and PowerCampus User Management  
To use the password policy, you need to add them on the setting menus of PowerCampus User  
Management and set up the policy mode to identity, active directory, ADFS or SAML  

Self-Service and PowerCampus User Management apply the password policy when you create  
users, on login, password changes. Administrators can unlock a user account and ask users to  
change their password on the next login attempt and when the password expires.  

Self-Service applies the password policy when you create a user for the ConEd, Application, or  
Shared Access Areas.  

Users can change their password in Self-Service or in the URL defined by the administrator user on  
the policy.  

For more information on this feature, see the PowerCampus Self-Service Administrator Guide.  

#### PowerCampus  
The logon retries category is not available anymore on the system setup menu and you can now  
configure this functionality through the password policy.  

PowerCampus applies the password policy when you create users, on login, and password  
changes. Administrators can unlock a user account, ask users to change their password on the next  
login attempt and when the password expires. To use the password policy, you need to set up the  
security mode to standard.  

To use the password history, you need to create a SQL Server certificate and key in your  
PowerCampus database server.
