## New Features  

### Self-Service  
The Self-Service provides these features for this release.  

#### Forgot password  
You can set up the forgot password option when adding or editing Identity, Active Directory, ADFS,  
and SAML user store.  

Users who have forgotten their password can reset their password and authenticate to Self-Service  
application.  

You can configure the CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and  
Humans Apart) to distinguish between a human user and an automated user such as a bot.  

You can configure the notification **Recover password by token or URL** to send an email to the user  
and recover the password.  

#### Email provider  
You can use the email provider page to enable staff to send emails from a Self-Service built-in page  
to a specific group of addresses. Pages: Approve Grades, Manage Advisees, Profile (Advisor),  
Authorize Registration, and Course Management.  

#### Notifications  
- You can now configure the notification **Recover Password by Token or URL** to send an email to  
  the user and recover the password.  
- You can now configure the notification **Account Created** to notify the users that their Self‑Service  
  account has been created.  
- You can configure the notification **Reset Password for Self-Service Users** to notify the users that  
  the administrator has reset their password.  

#### Timeout policy  
Self-Service and PowerCampus User Management introduce a timeout policy that allows you to  
configure the duration of the user's session per user store: Identity, Active Directory, ADFS, and  
SAML.  
- You can set a session timeout when adding or editing a user store in Self-Service and  
  PowerCampus User Management.  
- On new installs, the **timeout** attribute in the **authenticationsettings.config** file does not  
  exist.

  user, by default, the application requests to change password.  
  - On a new install, the **Requires Change Password at Next Log On** field is enabled by default  
    for the **siteadministrator** user.  
  - On upgrades, if the **siteadministrator** user has the default password, the **Requires Change  
    Password at Next Log on** is enabled for the **siteadministrator** user.  
- You can change the username for a Self-Service user when the creation store is Identity or  
  Active Directory.  
- When you create a new user, you can edit the username for a PowerCampus User Management  
  user.  
- You can create an AD user for PowerCampus User Management.  

### PowerCampus Identity APIs

Self-Service users outside the User Management application.
