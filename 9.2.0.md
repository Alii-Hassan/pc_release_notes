## Enhancements  

### Self-Service  
The Self-Service application provides these enhancements for this release.  

#### .Net 6, SQL Server 2019, and Windows Server 2019  
The following PowerCampus Self-Service applications supports .Net 6, SQL Server 2019, and  
Windows Server 2019.  
- PowerCampus Self-Service  
- PowerCampus User Management  
- PowerCampus User Management API  
- PowerCampus WebAPI services  
- PowerCampus Notifications  
- PowerCampus eTranscripts  

#### Overall grade comments  
Faculty, Faculty Assistant, and Department Head can view and edit overall grade comments on  
Course Management for midterm and final grades.  

#### PowerCampus Services  
Ellucian transitioned PowerCampus SOAP Services to WebAPI with the same functionality.  

You can explore the endpoints, read the documentation, and try them through the Swagger interface  

PowerCampus SOAP services is still available only for Payment Services as payment providers  
would need to transition to use the payment API. Payment Service does not require the  
configuration of the **InstitutionSettings.config**, it gets now the configuration from Self‑Service.  

PowerCampus SOAP services is still using .Net 4.6 application and Ellucian will deprecate it in the  
next PowerCampus release.  

PowerCampus Integration scripts supports PowerShell 7.2 (LTS) and Windows 10, Windows Server  
2016, and Windows Server 2019. The scripts use the WebAPI endpoints instead of the SOAP  
Services.  

### PowerCampus User Management  
The PowerCampus User Management application provides these enhancements for this release.  

#### User Management API menu  
You can create users on Identity and Active Directory providers, create custom roles, give access to  
specific endpoints and define password policies and access token expiration length.  

PowerCampus User Management API supports **Token**.  

#### Integration Services API menu  
You can create users on Identity and Active Directory providers, create custom roles, give access to  
specific endpoints and define password policies and access token expiration length.  

PowerCampus WebAPI supports **Token** and **Basic Authentication**.  

### PowerCampus  
The PowerCampus application provides these enhancements for this release.  

#### PowerCampus Online Help documentation  
Improved navigation and readability.  

#### PowerBuilder 2021 and SQL Server 2019  
The PowerCampus release supports PowerBuilder 2021 and SQL Server 2019. This upgrade  
provides you a new UI rendering to change the application screen from gray to white color. Also,  
introduces new components and libraries for the typography and the iconography, giving a better  
look and feel.  

This release replaces the existing Internet Explorer based web browser for a Chromium-based web  
browser component.
