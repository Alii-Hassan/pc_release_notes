## Enhancements  

### Self-Service  
The Self-Service application provides these enhancements for this release.  

#### 1098-T  
The files to generate and download 1098-T report were generated in Self-Service.  

#### Course Management  
In the overall grades page, after all activity grades are entered, the grade is calculated and the  
grade dropdowns are automatically populated. Previously, the value was displayed, however on  
Save the database was not updated. Now **STUDENTGRADE** table is updated on Save.  

#### File Download  
In Advising and Course Management, the application allows users to download files in **.docx**  
and **.xlsx** formats to allow compatibility with Word and Excel 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016, and 2019.  

#### Allow Change setting improvement  
- In the **Phone Number** tab, the wording of the **Allow Change** setting was improved to **Allow add  
  or change**.  
- In the **Emergency Contact** tabs, the wording of the **Allow Change** setting was improved to  
  **Allow change or delete**.  

#### Empty states UI design  
In Self-Service, the empty states pages are now in conformity with the Self-Service UI design  
standards.  

### PowerCampus  
The PowerCampus application provides these enhancements for this release.  

#### 1098-T  
For tax year 2022, the IRS does not require any update for 1098-T calculations.  

In addition, publication 1220 does not require any update to the Electronic File structure of the 1098‑T report. PowerCampus implemented an enhancement to remove the special characters of the  
student's name on the Payee B.  

### Ellucian Path Design System  
Ellucian updated the Ellucian Path Design System from version 5.5.0 to 6.7.0, which updates the  
DatePicker component and repairs vulnerabilities.  

### PowerCampus User Management  
The PowerCampus User Management application provides these enhancements for this release.  

#### AD Users  
If the connection is not valid when creating an Active Directory user, User Management now  
displays an error message.  

#### Ethos API  
The PowerCampus User Management application added a new menu to set up the Ethos API  
feature.  

The **Ethos API** menu allows to manage user accounts, roles, and to assign permissions.  

There are three main options:  
- **Users** – create and edit users, reset passwords, generate tokens, and delete accounts  
- **Roles** – create and delete roles and assign the claims to each role  
- **Settings** – define user stores and password policies  

### PowerCampus Web Administration  
From version 9.2.1 and onward, the PowerCampus Web Administration module includes existing  
and new features.  

- **PowerFAIDS (update)** – the webadmin user replaces the powercampus user. You should update  
  it in the appsetting configuration files.  
- **Notifications (new)** – you can set up notifications in the Web Administration module and in  
  PowerCampus Backoffice created on the Message Sources option. For example, you can  
  create messages on the Category of admissions, advising, and registration areas.  
- **Code tables (new)** – you can set up the code tables in the Web Administration module and in  
  PowerCampus Backoffice. Ethos APIs use code tables in Web Administration to create Ethos  
  mappings.  

### PowerCampus Regional Services  
PowerCampus Regional Services allows for applications specific to PowerCampus regions.  

As a new feature, PowerCampus renames the installers from **PowerCampus WebAdministration  
Installers** to **PowerCampus Regional Services Installers** and contains **Fiscal Records**, **Electronic  
Degree**, and **Electronic Certificate** applications.  

A new option was added to integrate the **Electronic Degree** application with the Mexican  
government Web Services to add the official stamps in the electronic degree documents. When you  
use these Web Services, the Mexican government can authenticate (when recognized as an official  
electronic degree) or reject.  

### PowerCampus Ethos APIs  
The PowerCampus Ethos APIs application provides these enhancements for this release.  

PowerCampus developed Ethos Data Model-based APIs to integrate with Ellucian applications,  
such as Ethos Integration, Ellucian Intelligent Learning Platform (ILP), and Ellucian Experience.  

The integration with ILP allows PowerCampus to send and receive information from a Learning  
Management System (LMS) such as Moodle, Canvas, Blackboard, or Brightspace. Ellucian  
Experience uses Ethos APIs to retrieve data from PowerCampus and to display the data in cards on  
the user's dashboard.
