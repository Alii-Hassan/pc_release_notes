## Highlights  

These release notes describe the enhancements and updates to the logging, privacy, security, and  
accessibility features in some of the PowerCampus applications.  

### Logging  
The event logging feature was added to allow administrators to keep track of the end-user  
authentication when accessing PowerCampus products. This feature provides information that can  
help tracking potential incidents, security breaches, unauthorized access attempts, and suspicious  
behavior.  

- The administrators can now track events like the login and log out of a user, login failures and  
  the permission evaluation.  
- The administrators can keep a registry of who has viewed, added, updated, or deleted any  
  person's health information, such as immunization or a disability.  

### Privacy  
This new release enhances privacy by protecting the end-user's personal information.  

- The new features in PowerCampus protect personally identifiable information (PII), such as the  
  National ID in PowerCampus Regional Services and SSNs in the PowerFAIDS application.  
- With PowerCampus, you can now keep a registry of who viewed, added, updated, or deleted  
  any person's health information.  

### Security  
The security enhancements help ensure secure and authenticated access to the system and its  
data.  

- This release introduces the reCAPTCHA validation services in the Application, Inquiry, ConEd,  
  and Make a gift features.  
- A new feature was introduced in PowerCampus that enables authentication with identity  
  providers.  
- This release introduces the session time out feature to close an end-user session in the  
  PowerCampus application after a defined period of inactivity.  

### Accessibility  
To improve the compliance of the accessibility guidelines, tests were performed on the  
PowerCampus web-based products — Self-Service, User Management, and Web Administration —  
with assistive technologies like NVDA, Apple VoiceOver, and Google Talkback.  

These tests were performed on the following operating systems and platforms:
