## Replication Steps
1. **Enroll a large number of students** (e.g., **80+**) in a course.
2. **Navigate to Course Management** â†’ **Overall Attendance page**.
3. **Page fails to load**, resulting in a **timeout error**.

---

## Expected Result
- The **Overall Attendance page** should **load properly**, regardless of **class size**.

## Actual Result

---

## Workaround

## Client Impact
- **Instructors cannot track attendance** for large courses.
- **Course management efficiency is impacted** due to **slow or failed loading** of attendance records.
