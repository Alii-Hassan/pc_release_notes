# PD0002504 - Self-Service Overall Grades: Slow Comments Entry & Overall Attendance Timeout

## Issue Summary
**Issue:**  
- **Entering grade comments** in **Self-Service > Classes > Overall Grades** is **very slow** for **courses with a large number of students**.
  - **Text input lags** (text does not appear immediately while typing).
  - **Tested with 5 students** → Works correctly.
  - **Tested with 88 students** → **Significant delay** observed.
- Additionally, for **courses with 40+ students**, **Overall Attendance page times out** when accessed.

**Severity:** 2 - High  
**Product Line:** PowerCampus - Self-Service  
**Found in Version:** 9.2.0  
**Resolution Date:** 2023-12-15

## Replication Steps
1. **Navigate to** Self-Service → **Classes → Overall Grades**.
2. **Enter a grade comment** for a student.
3. **Observe the lag** (text input takes seconds to appear).
4. **Try accessing the Overall Attendance page** for a large-enrollment course (40+ students).
5. **Observe the timeout error**.

---

## Expected Result
- **Grade comments should be responsive** regardless of class size.
- **Overall Attendance page should load without timing out**.

## Actual Result
- **Severe typing lag** when entering comments for **large classes**.
- **Overall Attendance page fails to load** for **large-enrollment courses**.

---

## Workaround
- **No effective workaround** available.

---

## Client Impact
- **Frustration for instructors** due to slow response times.
- **Increased time needed** to enter and manage comments for **large classes**.
- **Inability to access attendance records** for **large-enrollment courses**.

---

## Resolution
- **Text fields are now independent** from the **React render function**.
  - This **prevents typing lag**, ensuring that input appears immediately.
- **Optimized data retrieval** to **prevent timeouts** on the **Overall Attendance page**.
