## Highlights  

These release notes describe the enhancements and updates to the Gender X functionality, 1098‑T  
report, and the Windows Server support in some of the PowerCampus applications.  

### Gender X functionality  
PowerCampus is introducing a new functionality for Gender X. Gender X refers to a non-binary or  
gender‑neutral option that recognizes a gender identity outside of the traditional categories of male  
and female.  

### 1098-T update  
For the 2023 tax year, the IRS Publication 1220 does not need any changes.  

### Windows Server support for PowerCampus  
The PowerCampus compatibility with Windows Server has been refreshed in the updated support  
list.

## Enhancements  

### PowerCampus  
The version 9.2.3 of PowerCampus includes these enhancements in PowerCampus.  

#### Gender X  
There is a new functionality in PowerCampus called Gender X.  

> Gender is social and cultural. It’s how your identity relates to society’s idea of what it means to be a  
> woman, man, neither, or a mix of many genders.  

For most people, their gender matches up with the cultural expectations of the sex they were  
assigned at birth. This means they’re **cis-gender**. Others may self-identify as being **transgender**,  
**a‑gender**, **non-binary**, **gender fluid**, or any number of terms.  

In PowerCampus, a new code table was added to allow the user to select the gender for everyone  
and allow the institutions to define their own gender values (Gender X, Third Gender, etc.).  

The change is made due to requirements from U.S. Government instances, examples:  

- The NY Governor announced that New Yorkers can select 'X' as a gender-marker on their  
  driver’s license.  
- SUNY students are additionally able to select 'X' when asked to provide gender by the college.  
- Starting on April 11, 2022, U.S. citizens will be able to select an X as their gender marker on  
  their U.S. passport application.  

The definition of the X gender marker on U.S. State Department public forms is: _Unspecified or  
another gender identity_.  

This new functionality was implemented in several applications:  

- **PowerCampus**  
- **PowerCampus Self-Service**  
- **PowerCampus Web API**  
- **PowerCampus Ethos API**  

Processes updated in PowerCampus:  

- Duplicate checking  
- Power Up  
- Academic Records  
- Admissions  
- Billing  
- Cash Receipts  
- Advancement  

Processes updated in PowerCampus Self-Service:  

- Admissions  
- Profile  

Due to PowerCampus being used in several institutions and countries, the functionality can be  
enabled as needed. The functionality is disabled by default, and once enabled, it cannot be turned  
off again.  

This change also affected the PowerCampus database.  

#### Code Table in PowerCampus  
There is a new code table to manage the new Gender X functionality. The new code table name is:  
**CODE_GENDER** – Gender.  

> **Note**: The values F, M, and U cannot be modified because they are system-defined values.  

#### Advisory Report  
When run, the advisory report shows information regarding the Gender for a person's record in a  
database.  

Before PowerCampus 9.2.3 is installed, you must run the advisory report.  

In this version, due to the changes to the Gender X functionality, it is necessary to identify if there  
are values in the database other than **F**, **M**, **U** to correct them and avoid inconsistencies in the  
records.

### Self-Service  
The version 9.2.3 of PowerCampus includes these enhancements in PowerCampus Self-Service.  

#### Course Materials Setup  
In **Administration > Website setup > Course Materials**, we've aimed to streamline the setup of  
Course Materials URLs and enhance flexibility in managing the availability of Course Materials links  
across different periods. We are introducing a setup page for **Course Materials URL** configuration.  

With **URL configuration**, users with access rights can input provider URLs. Access to this page is  
restricted to users with the necessary claim to access **Course Materials**.  

#### Period Filter for Course Materials  
The new **New Period filter** functionality under **Period > Filters > Students** enhances your control  
over course materials. This functionality empowers users to selectively access the sections for  
specific periods to enable the course materials links.  

With the **Period Filter**, users can customize their experience by toggling periods on or off. For  
instance, if the filter for the 2015 Spring, session 01 is deactivated, sections in this period will not  
have the course materials link. If the filter for the 2024 Spring, session 01 is enabled, the  
corresponding link for sections in this period will be available.  

#### Section link for Course Materials  
The **Section Details** window now includes a link that directs users to the Course Materials URL  
specified in the setup.  

---

### Regional Services  
In **PowerCampus Electronic Certificate**, you can choose either only the approved courses or all  
the student courses, approved or not approved ones, to be included in the electronic certificate  
document.  

This selection is included in both the XML and original string formats of the electronic certificate  
document.  

---

## Updates  

### Windows Server support  
Review this list outlining the currently supported and deprecated versions of Windows for  
PowerCampus and Self-Service applications.  

- **Windows Server 2022** is supported.  
- **Windows Server 2016** is no longer supported.  

### PowerCampus 1098-T report  
For the tax year 2023, the IRS Publication 1220 does not require any update in the electronic file  
layout.  

In addition, for tax year 2023, the IRS does not require any update for the boxes calculations in the  
1098‑T report.  

### Updates to the Roles in Self-Service  
In Self-Service, when logging in, the role synchronization takes place when the user enters their  
password and initiates the action to complete the sign-in process, applicable across all  
authentication types.

  APIs:
