## Enhancements  

### PowerCampus  
The version 9.2.4 of PowerCampus includes these enhancements in PowerCampus.  

#### CRM Recruit Integration  
You can now map CRM Recruit and PowerCampus values in the Web Administration module.  

The mapping tables display a list of all available tables that can be mapped, allowing you to add,  
edit, or delete records as needed.  

You can access **Mapping Tables** directly from the Web Administration module, and two convenient  
options have been added:  
- **Recruit Integration**  
- **Code Tables**  

Depending on the mapping types, Web Administration presents three mapping options: **1‑to‑1**,  
**1‑to‑2**, or **1‑to‑3**.  

Ellucian has eliminated the need for a separate installer. When installing the Web Administration  
module, you can configure the Recruit database directly in the configuration file. Additionally, within  
PowerCampus, you can set up a user profile with access to Recruit Integration, enabling you to use  
this feature seamlessly.  

If you associated mapping codes using the Mapper Tool in previous versions, migrating to version  
9.2.4 will not retain the mapping values in the **RecruiterMapping.xml** file. You must recreate the  
mappings using the **Recruit Integration** option in the Web Administration application.  

For more information, see the **PowerCampus Web Administration Handbook**.  

**Mapping Enhancements**  
- **IPEDS Ethnicity mapping**: Improved PowerCampus mapping to match intuitively with the  
  selected Recruit code category. Users can now see the subrace and its corresponding IPEDS  
  federal category in the PowerCampus mapping for better accuracy.  
- **Education**: In the Education Institution mapping table, you can now filter results by Recruit  
  code value and Organization values. Additionally, pagination functionality has been added to  
  enhance navigation.  
- **County**: Introduced the ability to create a manual mapping for County. For the Recruit field, you  
  must enter the County value manually for this mapping. The value that you entered manually  
  will be sent for the API to be processed.  
- **Auto Mapping**: To perform auto-mapping, PowerCampus provides two options:  
  - **Mapping All Values**: This option creates records for all Recruit codes, regardless of whether  
    there is a matching PowerCampus code.  
  - **Exact Matches Only**: This option creates records only when there are exact matches  
    between the Recruit code and the PowerCampus code.  

**API Enhancements**  
The endpoint now receives a JSON-formatted body containing information to be processed by  
PowerCampus. This enhancement includes the ability to receive and handle the following fields:  

- **Citizenship**  
- **Address line 4**  
- **Primary Language**  
- **Education information**  
- **Emergency Contacts (Relationship and Last name prefix)**  
- **Address Type**: Addresses now use the address hierarchy to identify the primary address.  

**Notes**  
- **Activity type**: To ensure correct mapping between the Recruit code, Activity type code, and  
  Activity code value, select the same used in the code tables configuration.  
- **Student Coding configuration**: Select the appropriate Full/Part Time Status value to ensure the  
  correct values are reflected in Application. The Full/Part Time flag may change depending on  
  the Student Coding configuration.  

#### Password reset  
You can now create long passwords. When a reset is requested, the input field has been fixed to  
create up to 30-character passwords.  

You can paste it, or type it in.  

In the same window, when the system requires a password reset, the **OK** and **CLOSE** buttons  
have changed places, and are now displayed in the same order as on the login screen.  

### PowerCampus Regional Services  
The PowerCampus Regional Services application provides these enhancements for this release.  

#### Fiscal Records  
With this update, the due dates for CFDI cancellations of previous periods align with the dates  
informed by the SAT (Mexican Tax Administration Service).  

#### Electronic Degree  
With the date format standardization, the date format is now unified across Electronic Degree UI  
pages, the original string, and the unsigned XML. The standardized format now uses "-" instead of  
"/".  

### PowerCampus Self-Service  
The PowerCampus Self-Service application provides these enhancements for this release.  

#### Advising  
Any advisor, when they open the details of any student, the **LOW GRADES** warning is now visible.  

#### Registration Summary  
There is a new enhancement to improve the ease of navigation.  
In **Profile**, the **Log** column has been removed so now you can access the **Registration Summary**  
tab by clicking the **Date** column, which is now the first one. After this, you can click the **Date** link  
to see the details.  

#### Registration  
In **Registration**, another enhancement is when course details are displayed.  
- When the student is in a registration group that is open for registration for one session within a  
  term but not open for another session within a term.  
- The student adds a course to the wait list for the session that is not open for registration.  
- When the student clicks **register**.  

So now the registration summary status is: **In cart**, **Register now**, **Registration period has ended**.  

#### Authorize Registration  
There is a new enhancement with the recent updates to introduce refined functionality within the  
**Advising > Authorize Registration** feature in PowerCampus Self-Service.  

These changes improve the ability to authorize or unauthorize sessions when the institution has  
multiple sessions per Year/Term, for example, more than twelve sessions. The advisor can now  
update multiple sessions without the need to select sessions individually; there is now an option to  
authorize/unauthorize **all** sessions in a period, and also the advisor can view the details of the  
authorized sessions by each student.  

#### Course Statistics  
There is a new enhancement when the course statistics are shown.  
In the **Course Management** section under **Classes**, then in the **Overall Grades** subsection, if a  
course does not have any statistics to display when you click the **Statistics** button, instead of  
showing an empty table, now an image and the phrase **"There are no statistics available"** are  
visible.  

#### Registration notification  
There is a new enhancement when a student performs registration and the notification is sent.  
The name and description of the notification when a student completes the registration has been  
updated. Also, the final course status is now part of the sections token in the message information,  
so the students have a clear indication of the course situation.
