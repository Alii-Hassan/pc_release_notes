## Workaround
To enable automatic email sending, follow these steps:
1. Go to **Cash Receipts Tools** → **Setup** → **Cash Receipts**.
2. Navigate to the **Receipt Form** tab.
3. Configure the email to be automatically sent.

For manual processing, the administrator can execute the following stored procedure:
```sql
EXEC spCreateCashReceiptMessage @Email, @CashReceiptNumber
```
This should trigger the message, provided that all necessary configurations are in place.

## Additional Information
The issue is related to the `CashReceiptNumber`. In PowerBuilder, the code attempts to cast this value, but if it exceeds 32,700 records, it fails to process correctly. 

To confirm, the following SQL query was run:
```sql
SELECT * FROM ABT_SETTINGS 
WHERE AREA_NAME = 'BILLING' 
AND SECTION_NAME = 'NEXTKEY' 
AND LABEL_NAME = 'CASHRECEIPTNUMBER'
```

The query showed that the `CashReceiptNumber` had exceeded 111,000 entries, which contributed to the issue.

A PowerBuilder code change is required to resolve this issue in version **9.3.0**.

---

## Client Impact
Users are unable to send emails from the Cash Receipts entry window.

---

## Resolution
The problem was due to a data type limitation. The variable storing the receipt number was of type `int`, but PowerBuilder has a limit of **32,767** for this type. The solution was to update the variable’s data type to match the database’s `long` type.
