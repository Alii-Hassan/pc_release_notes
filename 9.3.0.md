## Highlights  

### PowerFAIDS Cloud  
PowerCampus now includes support for integration with PowerFAIDS Cloud.  

- **PowerCampus to PowerFAIDS Cloud**: PowerCampus sends CSV files to facilitate the  
  integration with PowerFAIDS Cloud, ensuring accurate data exchange.  
- **PowerFAIDS Cloud into PowerCampus**: PowerFAIDS Cloud introduced new standard reports  
  for Anticipated Aid and Disbursements as part of this integration. These reports support the  
  transfer of data from PowerFAIDS Cloud into PowerCampus through CSV files. Later, in  
  PowerCampus, new import scripts now update the Anticipated Aid and Disbursement data in  
  the database.  
- **PowerCampus Desktop Compatibility**: The existing PowerCampus Desktop functionality  
  remains unchanged and continues to operate as before, unaffected by the new cloud  
  integration feature.  

The PowerFAIDS Cloud setup no longer requires the Events Generator as a prerequisite for  
installation.
