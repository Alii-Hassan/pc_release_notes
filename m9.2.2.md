## Highlights

These release notes describe the enhancements and updates to the logging, privacy, security, and accessibility features in some of the PowerCampus applications.

### Logging

The event logging feature was added to allow administrators to keep track of end-user authentication when accessing PowerCampus products. This feature provides information that can help track potential incidents, security breaches, unauthorized access attempts, and suspicious behavior.

- Administrators can now track events like the login and logout of a user, login failures, and permission evaluations.
- Administrators can keep a registry of who has viewed, added, updated, or deleted any person's health information, such as immunization or disability records.

### Privacy

This new release enhances privacy by protecting the end-user's personal information.

- PowerCampus protects personally identifiable information (PII), such as the National ID in PowerCampus Regional Services and SSNs in the PowerFAIDS application.
- PowerCampus allows tracking of who viewed, added, updated, or deleted any person's health information.

### Security

The security enhancements ensure secure and authenticated access to the system and its data.

- This release introduces reCAPTCHA validation services in the Application, Inquiry, ConEd, and Make a Gift features.
- A new authentication feature enables integration with identity providers.
- The session timeout feature automatically closes an end-user session after a defined period of inactivity.

### Accessibility

To improve compliance with accessibility guidelines, tests were performed on PowerCampus web-based products, including Self-Service, User Management, and Web Administration, using assistive technologies like NVDA, Apple VoiceOver, and Google Talkback.

**Testing was conducted on the following platforms:**

- **NVDA:** Commands and keyboard functions tested on Microsoft Windows 10.
- **Apple VoiceOver:** Keyboard commands tested on macOS 11 or higher.
- **Apple VoiceOver:** Gestures tested on iOS 14 or higher.
